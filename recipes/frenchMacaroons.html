        <p>Fantabulous colored, bite-sized macaroons. Divide batter into thirds; color one portion pink and flavor with raspberry, another yellow with lemon flavoring, and the remaining pale blue with vanilla flavoring. Fill and make sandwich cookies with filling of choice, like peach jam or strawberry preserves. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>3 egg whites</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons superfine (castor) sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup almond meal </li>
                <li>⅓ cup milk </li>
                <li>1⅓ cups confectioners' sugar </li>
            </ul>

                <li>Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F <mark class = "imp-text">(160 degrees C)</mark>. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone mat.</li>
                <li>Sift almond meal and confectioners' sugar over beaten egg whites; gently fold in, retaining as much air as possible.</li>
                <li>Divide meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color, if desired.</li>
                <li>Spoon meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 3/8-inch tip. Pipe 1-inch disks of meringue onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies.</li>
                <li>Let cookies stand at room temperature to form a thin skin, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Lift the baking sheets; let drop from several inches above the work surface to adhere cookies to the baking sheets.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry, about 15 minutes; let cool completely on the baking sheets before peeling off the parchment paper, about 45 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
